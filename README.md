# Plant Disease Predictor

This repository contains a Streamlit web application that can predict plant diseases based on uploaded images.  It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the disease and provide a prediction to the user.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a simple and accessible tool for identifying plant diseases.  By uploading an image of a plant leaf, users can quickly get a prediction of the potential disease affecting the plant. This can be a valuable resource for farmers, gardeners, and plant enthusiasts to take timely action and prevent further spread of diseases.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Plant-Disease-Predictor.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Plant-Disease-Predictor.git)  # Replace with your repo URL
    cd Plant-Disease-Predictor
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv  # Or python -m venv venv on Windows
    source venv/bin/activate  # Activate on Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate on Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    (Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all your project's dependencies. Example below)

## Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit app:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Open the app in your web browser:** Streamlit will provide a URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) that you can use to access the application.

3.  **Upload an image:** Use the file uploader to select an image of a plant leaf.

4.  **Predict the disease:** Click the "Predict Disease" button to get the prediction.

## Model Training

This section should describe how the machine learning model was trained.  Include details about:

*   **Dataset:** What dataset was used for training?  Provide a link if possible.
*   **Model Architecture:** What type of model was used (e.g., CNN, ResNet, etc.)?
*   **Training Process:** Briefly describe the training process, including hyperparameters, epochs, etc.
*   **Model Saving:** Explain how the trained model and class names were saved (e.g., using `pickle`).

(If you have a separate notebook or script for training, include instructions on how to run it.)
